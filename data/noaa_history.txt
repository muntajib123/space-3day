Rationale: Geomagnetic storm levels are likely to begin early on 01 Dec,

Rationale: R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) radio blackouts are expected, with a
slight chance for R3 (Strong) or greater events, over 20-22 Apr due to
the flare potential of several active regions on the visible disk.

Rationale: The geomagnetic field is likely to reach G1 (Minor)
geomagnetic storm levels, with a chance for an isolated G2 (Moderate)
storm period, on 12 Oct as effects from a CME that left the sun on 09

Rationale: Isolated periods of G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storming are
likely by mid to late UTC day on 31 Dec due to CME effects from a
partial-halo event from 29 Dec. Lingering G1 (Minor) geomagnetic
storming is likely, with a chance for G2 (Moderate) levels, on 01 Jan
with the arrival of the second CME, also from 29 Dec.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-18 over the past 24 hours, was
below S-scale storm level thresholds.

Rationale: M-class flares are expected (R1-R2/Minor-Moderate), with a

primarily due to the flare potential of Region 3936.

Rationale: G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storming is likely 04-05 Jan, first
due to possible glancing CME effects from an event that left the Sun on
01 Jan and then to recurrent, positive polarity CH HSS effects.

slightly on days 2 and 3 (04 & 05 Jan) as ARs 3938 (N16W61, Cao/beta),
3940 (S06, L=083), 3939 and 3946 (S10W62, Dao/beta) approach the western
